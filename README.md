# Django Voting Example
This example provides a simple voting system, where your vote includes all available options, but ordered by the ones you preffer the most and subject to a budget.

You can setup multiple voting processes in order to add the voting choices.

This project uses SQLite and can be easily deployed to Heroku.

Notice that the project is branded with the Continuum.cl brand.
